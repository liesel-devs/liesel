# Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.



```{python}
import liesel.model as lsl
```


## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).


Equations:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + x_i \beta_1 + \varepsilon_i
$$


```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
y <- rnorm(10)
plot(x, y)
```

```{r}
x
```
