Welcome to the tutorials page for Liesel, a probabilistic programming framework for developing semi-parametric regression models and custom Bayesian inference algorithms. In these tutorials, you will learn how to use Liesel to express statistical models as probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), manipulate and update them with ease, and run efficient and modular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures with different kernels.

Here are the basics to get you started, ranging from simple linear regression up to
location-scale models:
